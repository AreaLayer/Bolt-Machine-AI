# Bolt Machine(PoC)

Simple Proof of Concept on Bolt Machine

## How works?

 ### Open Channel
 
    	Gather information about the available nodes and their channels.
    	Evaluate potential channels based on factors such as node reputation, liquidity, fees, and geographic proximity.
    	Select the most suitable node for opening a new channel.
    	Initiate the channel opening process with the selected node.
     
 ### Close Channel
 
    	Retrieve information about the open channels associated with your node.
    	Evaluate channels based on factors such as channel health, activity, and fees.
    	Identify channels that are no longer beneficial or have low liquidity.
    	Initiate the channel closing process for the identified channels.
 
 ### Replace Channel
 
    	Gather information about the available nodes and their channels.
    	Evaluate existing channels based on factors such as liquidity, fees, and activity.
    	Identify channels that could be replaced with better options.
    	Initiate the channel closing process for the identified channels.
    	Follow the steps for opening a new channel to replace the closed channel.
 
 ### Find Better Inbound Liquidity
 
    	Collect information about your node's current inbound liquidity and its associated channels.
    	Evaluate the liquidity levels, fees, and activity of the existing channels.
    	Identify channels that have insufficient inbound liquidity or high fees.
    	Look for nodes that have well-connected channels and high inbound liquidity.
    	Initiate the channel closing process for the identified channels with poor inbound liquidity.
    	Follow the steps for opening new channels with nodes that provide better inbound liquidity.
    	The data can be backed by Ambooss, 1ML, LightningNetwork+, etc

**Note**: The implementation details of each step may vary depending on the specific Lightning Network implementation you are using. Additionally, it's important to consider factors like network topology, transaction fees, and security when making decisions about opening, closing, or replacing channels
