# Lightning AI (PoC)

Simple Proof of Concept on Lightning AI

## How works?

 ## Open Channel:
    	Gather information about the available nodes and their channels.
    	Evaluate potential channels based on factors such as node reputation, liquidity, fees, and geographic proximity.
    	Select the most suitable node for opening a new channel.
    	Initiate the channel opening process with the selected node.
     

Note: The implementation details of each step may vary depending on the specific Lightning Network implementation you are using. Additionally, it's important to consider factors like network topology, transaction fees, and security when making decisions about opening, closing, or replacing channels

## Roadmap
